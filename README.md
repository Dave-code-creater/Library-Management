**Library Management System in C++**

**Overview:**
This project is a simple implementation of a library management system in C++. It allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, deleting, and searching for books in a library database.

**Features:**
1. **Add Book:** Allows users to add a new book to the library database by providing details such as title, author, genre, and ISBN.
2. **Borrow Book:** Enables users to delete a book from the library database based on its ISBN.
3. **Search Book:** Allows users to search for a book by its title, author, genre, or ISBN.
4. **Display All Books:** Displays a list of all books currently available in the library database.
5. **Update Book Details:** Allows users to update the details of a book such as title, author, or genre.
6. **Save Data:** Automatically saves all changes made to the library database to a file for future reference.
7. **Load Data:** Loads the library database from a file at the beginning of the program.

**Dependencies:**
This project does not require any external libraries or dependencies. It is built using standard C++ libraries.

**Installation:**
To use this library management system, simply download the source code files and compile them using a C++ compiler such as g++.

**Usage:**
1. Compile the source code files:
   ```
   g++ main.cpp Book.cpp Library.cpp -o library_manager
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./library_manager
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, searching, and updating books in the library.
